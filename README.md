# Library App

This is a small Library application built as a part of [The Odin Project Curriculum](https://www.theodinproject.com/lessons/javascript-library). The application allows users to keep track of books in their library, with the ability to add, delete, and toggle the read status of books.

## Features

- Add new books to the library
- Delete books from the library
- Toggle the read status of a book
- Persistent data: The library data is stored in the browser's localStorage, so your data will persist between sessions

## Technologies Used

- CSS
- JavaScript

## Setup

## Future Improvements

- Implement a backend to store data
